## Why Analytics Matter

At its core, Three-Point Tracker is designed to monitor three key metrics in any area of your life—be it health, work, or habits. But raw data only tells part of the story. Advanced analytics turn those numbers into actionable insights, helping you spot trends, identify bottlenecks, and celebrate wins.
